This project is a visual enhancement mod for **Quake 3 Arena**, created using  
**RTX Remix 1.2.4**, **Quake3e**, **imgupscaler.ai**, and **Photopea**.  
It brings modern PBR-style textures and ray-tracing compatible materials to the game while keeping original gameplay completely intact.

> **Note:** Only textures are remastered — **no models** have been modified yet.

## 📥 Installation (START HERE — IMPORTANT!)

### 1️⃣ Go to your Quake 3 installation directory (Steam)

`Steam/steamapps/common/Quake 3 Arena/baseq3`

---

### 2️⃣ Copy the mod files

Copy **everything** from this mod’s `baseq3` folder into your own:
`Quake 3 Arena/baseq3`


Let Windows overwrite files if it asks — this is correct.

---

### 3️⃣ Change the screen resolution (optional)

Open:
`baseq3/autoexec.cfg`


Look for the following lines:

r_customWidth "xxxx"
r_customHeight "xxxx"

Replace `xxxx` with your resolution.  
The default included in this mod is:

`r_customWidth "1920"`
`r_customHeight "1080"`


---

### 4️⃣ DO NOT CHANGE ANY IN-GAME GRAPHIC SETTINGS

This is extremely important.

RTX Remix and Quake3e require specific settings already included in the config.  
Changing graphics or game options can break:

- lighting  
- reflections  
- material PBR properties  
- texture assignments  

Just launch and play.

## 🛠 Tools Used

### Engines & Rendering
- **NVIDIA RTX Remix 1.2.4**

## 📌 Known Limitations

- 3D objects / Models have not been remastered yet
- Textures dont have animations
- Some textures might not be remastered or have strange roughness effects
- RTX might not hook / work if a different, "Quake3e.exe" or "opengl32.dll" is used
- Playing Q3DM1 or Q3DM6 without "devmap" might have sky issues (playing over normal singleplayer)
- UI / HUD textures are not remastered yet

---
